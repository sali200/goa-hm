      <h1>Black Holes</h1>
      Black holes are among the most mysterious cosmic objects, much studied but not fully understood. These objects
      aren’t really holes. They’re huge concentrations of matter packed into very tiny spaces. A black hole is so dense
      that gravity just beneath its surface, the event horizon, is strong enough that nothing – not even light – can
      escape. The event horizon isn’t a surface like Earth’s or even the Sun’s. It’s a boundary that contains all the
      matter that makes up the black hole.

      There is much we don’t know about black holes, like what matter looks like inside their event horizons. However,
      there is a lot that scientists do know about black holes.</p>

      <p class="pp" style="font-size: 25px; font-family: sans-serif;">Black holes are some of the strangest and most
        fascinating objects in space. They're extremely dense, with such strong gravitational attraction that not even
        light can escape their grasp.

        The Milky Way could contain over 100 million black holes, though detecting these gluttonous beasts is very
        difficult. At the heart of the Milky Way lies a supermassive black hole — Sagittarius A*. The colossal structure
        is about 4 million times the mass of the sun and lies approximately 26,000 light-years away from Earth,
        according to a statement from NASA.

        The first image of a black hole was captured in 2019 by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) collaboration. The
        striking photo of the black hole at the center of the M87 galaxy 55 million light-years from Earth thrilled
        scientists around the world.</p>

        Black holes are expected to form via two distinct channels. According to the first pathway, they are stellar
        corpses, so they form when massive stars die. Stars whose birth masses are above roughly 8 to 10 times mass of
        our sun, when they exhaust all their fuel — their hydrogen — they explode and die leaving behind a very compact
        dense object, a black hole. The resulting black hole that is left behind is referred to as a stellar mass black
        hole and its mass is of the order of a few times the mass of the sun.

        Not all stars leave behind black holes, stars with lower birth masses leave behind a neutron star or a white
        dwarf. Another way that black holes form is from the direct collapse of gas, a process that is expected to
        result in more massive black holes with a mass ranging from 1000 times the mass of the sun up to even 100,000
        times the mass of the sun. This channel circumvents the formation of the traditional star, and is believed to
        operate in the early universe and produce more massive black hole seeds.</p>
