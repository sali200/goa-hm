  <h4>Birth Of The <br> Space Age</h4>

      <h1>Cosmonauts: Birth of the Space Age</h1>
      Russia has navigated the turmoil of the modern age with powerful dreams of technological and social
      transformation. Turning their eyes towards the sky, the Russian people pioneered space travel, becoming the first
      nation to launch satellites, animals and humans into orbit. These events turned science fiction into reality,
      transcending both the Earth's atmosphere and the Cold War political climate. Russia's early achievement was seen
      as a challenge by America, and fierce competition eventually led to the loss of the race to the Moon. However,
      this period of tension has since given way to an era of international cooperation. With over a century of rich
      cultural history and daring technological innovation, the Russian space programme remains a world leader in manned
      space flight.</p>

      <p class="pp" style="font-size: 25px; font-family: sans-serif;">Twenty years after NASA's Apollo 11 made history
        by taking America's astronauts to the Moon, Soviet Russia acknowledged the existence of its own manned lunar
        programme. Competition with the Americans and technical problems were responsible for keeping the project
        strictly confidential. It was not until 1989, during a new era of openness in the Soviet government, that its
        details became publicly known. Having come as far as building a manned lunar ship, the Soviet space programme
        ultimately lost its leading role because of ineffective organisation and a depleted budget. In the midst of
        this, the main driving force behind the Soviet space programme, and its Chief Designer, Sergei Korolev died
        unexpectedly during an operation in 1966.</p>

      <p class="p1">


        Russia's century-long fascination with space travel has been fuelled by a unique mixture of spiritual, cultural
        and political ideologies. Russia's revolution in 1917 encouraged many to contemplate new worlds, both on Earth
        and out in the cosmos. Enthusiasts gathered to design rockets, while others engaged through art, literature,
        cinema and architecture. After the Second World War, Russia's path into the cosmos depended on the technological
        breakthroughs of military ballistic missiles. To the astonishment of the world, this also gave Russia the means
        of launching a spacecraft.</p>
