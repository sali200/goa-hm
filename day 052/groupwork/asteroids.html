        The first asteroid was discovered on January 1, 1801, by the astronomer Giuseppe Piazzi at Palermo, Italy. At
        first Piazzi thought he had discovered a comet; however, after the orbital elements of the object had been
        computed, it became clear that the object moved in a planetlike orbit between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter.
        Because of illness, Piazzi was able to observe the object only until February 11. Although the discovery was
        reported in the press, Piazzi only shared details of his observations with a few astronomers and did not publish
        a complete set of his observations until months later. With the mathematics then available, the short arc of
        observations did not allow computation of an orbit of sufficient accuracy to predict where the object would
        reappear when it moved back into the night sky, so some astronomers did not believe in the discovery at all.</p>

        <p class="pp" style="font-size: 25px; font-family: sans-serif;">The discovery of three more faint objects in
          similar orbits over the next six years—Pallas, Juno, and Vesta—complicated that elegant solution to the
          missing-planet problem and gave rise to the surprisingly long-lived though no longer accepted idea that the
          asteroids were remnants of a planet that had exploded.

          Following that flurry of activity, the search for the planet appears to have been abandoned until 1830, when
          Karl L. Hencke renewed it. In 1845 he discovered a fifth asteroid, which he named Astraea.</p>

        <h2 class="h2">physical nature</h2>
        <p class="p1">


          During much of the 19th century, most discoveries concerning asteroids were based on studies of their orbits.
          The vast majority of knowledge about the physical characteristics of asteroids—for example, their size, shape,
          rotation period, composition, mass, and density—was learned beginning in the 20th century, in particular since
          the 1970s. As a result of such studies, those objects went from being merely “minor” planets to becoming small
          worlds in their own right. The discussion below follows that progression in knowledge, focusing first on
          asteroids as orbiting bodies and then on their physical nature.</p>
