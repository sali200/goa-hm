            <h1>Galaxies </h1>
            <p>Galaxies consist of stars, planets, and vast clouds of gas and dust, all bound together by gravity. The
                largest contain trillions of stars and can be more than a million light-years across. The smallest can
                contain a few thousand stars and span just a few hundred light-years. Most large galaxies have
                supermassive black holes at their centers, some with billions of times the Sun’s mass.
