    <p>I went to school in 2013 when I was 6 years old, where I made a bunch of friends, got a bunch of knowledge, and grew up... now I'm 16 and I'm in 12th grade, I'm finishing soon and I decided that I want a profession in programming, for this I joined the academy (GOA) and I'm sure that it will give me a good education and everything will work out for me in the long run, the main thing is not to give up and go to the end?</p>
