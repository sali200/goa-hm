<!-- 
 we learnt inline, internal and external css.
 
 inline as the name tells us is written inside the tag with style attribute

 with internal css we have to use style tag that is written inside head tag and doesnt need other css files.

 external css is the best option in my opinion. when we use it we need to  create another css file and we style the html there
